Hi, I'm Ziad! A Software Engineer in Test. I used to organize Ministry of Testing Cairo meetups. I try to question everything not through insecurity or fear of the unknown but in search of meaning ðŸ¤”

Iâ€™m also a learning fanatic, a football fan, and an avid watcher of goofy sitcoms. This is my space, where I get to express myself and interact with others. I love discussing exciting ideas, so feel free to drop me a message [here](https://ziadtawfeek.typeform.com/to/Yriu8h)
