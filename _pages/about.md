Hi, I'm Ziad! A Software Engineer in Test. I organize [Ministry of Testing Cairo](https://www.meetup.com/Ministry-of-Testing-Cairo/ "Ministry of Testing Cairo") meetups. I try to question everything not through insecurity or fear of the unknown but in search of meaning ðŸ¤”

Iâ€™m also a learning fanatic, football fan and I enjoy goofy sitcoms. This is my space where I get to express myself and interact with others.
I love discussing interesting ideas, feel free to drop me a message [here](https://ziadtawfeek.typeform.com/to/Yriu8h)
