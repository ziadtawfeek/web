Two months ago, I finished [Lost and Founder: A Painfully Honest Field Guide to the Startup World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957156-lost-and-founder) and there were some chapter that was titled '**If Management Is The Only Way Up, We 're all F***ed**'. It made me reflect on some thoughts I had and as luck would have it, I also stumbled on a related question on Quora.

> [A developer with weaker programming skill was promoted to lead engineer in my company, I asked the CTO for a reason, he responded to me that a lead developer doesn't need to be the best developer in the team, how true is that?](https://www.quora.com/A-developer-with-weaker-programming-skill-was-promoted-to-lead-engineer-in-my-company-I-asked-the-CTO-for-a-reason-he-responded-to-me-that-a-lead-developer-doesnt-need-to-be-the-best-developer-in-the-team-how-true)

From my personal experience till this moment, the short answer is **Yes but it really depends**.

There's a belief that anyone can be a people manager, all it takes is the will to manage, have an understanding of the problem space and be a good leader, right? **Definitely no!**

I used to believe that somehow this is true, can you be a great football team manager without playing great? Actually yes, you can simply google **[Jose Mourinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho)!**

I now believe this was the **[Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)** in mind. The effect is , the incompetent are always overly convinced of their competency. People with no experience or low ability at a task overestimate their ability. Without the self-awareness, people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence.

**Opposing Opinion: But the best managers I have, have previously done the work themselves and got their hands dirty (they were effective as Individual Contributors)?**

This impossibly hard to argue with based on my previous experience, **most of the great managers I have worked with were technically solid and great at understanding, motivating people** but not every manager needs to have a great track record as an individual contributor.

> Here's the catch much of the time great managers were great, good or at least performed well as an individual contributors but this is a correlation and does not apply to every individual contributor who performed greatly.

It may be possible to be a great manager and overcome incompetences in the specific subject matter by relying on, listening and trusting your team to help you understand what you don’t know, that’s what a **service-minded leader** could do. But it takes a **serious listener** who is well aware of their lack of relevant knowledge, and great, experienced team members willing to help them. Possible, but rarely happens in my experience so far.

A very important thing to mention is that **sometimes when a manager doesn't have great technical skills.** Team members upgrade, support each other and take an extreme ownership of the work they do.

Also when in doubt, you can refer to **Google**'s internal research on what behaviors make great managers great at an organization as part of the **re:Work** subject researchers.
