**For months, there was speculation about how the economic situation is going to grim that some fear may be as bad as the 1918 crisis and that is the case with COVID-19 hitting the globe. I think now more than ever we need to support each other**. We are all affected together, certainly, but you can't do much about that to stay at home and try to flatten the curve.

So, I had to stop thinking of the aftermath, take my mind off that, do something productive and write this blog!

Day-to-day. What matters is who you are, and how do you react to bad times. If you're the right sort of person, you'll find a way to win even in a bad economy. And if you're not, a good economy won't save you.

When we started to co-organize Ministry of Testing Cario, I always wondered about how do Software Testers in Egypt support each other outside of their workplace, I felt an unease that we have not so many communities around and no perfect place to cooperate where you can be around like-minded professionals of the same craft in a venue. That's why we started co-organizing Ministry of Testing Cairo meetups. I always thought that if you have a knowledge that might make life easier, you are obliged to share it and how this will make a difference to your community and network.

Since social life has been halted and these are hard times for everyone, we should strive on how to empower each other now more than ever for what’s coming ahead :muscle:

#### That’s why I’m setting a daily challenge on how I can try to add value to my network. I enjoy supporting, mentoring and below what I can help you with anything top off your mind.

Let’s grab a coffee and meet remotely for an hour :coffee: Feel free to drop me a message here :point_right: :inbox_tray: [https://ziadtawfeek.typeform.com/to/Yriu8h](https://ziadtawfeek.typeform.com/to/Yriu8h "https://ziadtawfeek.typeform.com/to/Yriu8h") and I will reach out to you to discuss anything in your mind.

#### #StaySafe #TogetherAtHome
